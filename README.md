# Hi, I'm @j-reher!

I am a technology consultant and Ph.D. candidate in physics at the Ruhr-University Bochum.

As a consultant, I assist my clients to extract the maximum value from their business data by analysing data for them or designing and implementing ETL and monitoring solutions.

As part of my research in the field of hadron physics, I analyzed data taken by the BESIII experiment in Beijing, China, and contributed to the construction of the upcoming <abbr title="(Anti-)Proton Annihilation in Darmstadt">PANDA</abbr> experiment by designing a process for screening a large number of components for its detector and organizing its execution.
