# Hi, I'm @j-reher!

I am a consultant at Senacor Technologies and a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the Ruhr-University Bochum.

As part of my research in the field of hadron physics, I analyzed data taken by the BESIII experiment in Beijing, China, and contributed to the construction of the upcoming <abbr title="(Anti-)Proton Annihilation in Darmstadt">PANDA</abbr> experiment by designing a process for screening a large number of components for its detector and organizing its execution.
